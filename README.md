# Machine Learning

I've tried to accomplish the task of Detecting number plate in the image (Localization) and Number plate Number extraction (OCR). But the code is doing what we needed actually. There are two python files in the repository. One (number-plate-detection.py) is manual image processing and data extraction from scratch. I used OpenCV for Python to do that. The other REST-API.py is very accurate in results, i.e. it uses commercial OPEN ALPR API which is only 2000 images/month is free of cost later we have to pay.
